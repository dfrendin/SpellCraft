# SpellCraft

A RPG Maker MV plugin.

## Getting Started

Download a copy of this repository to your local machine. Copy the core plugin should located at SpellCraft_Core\js\plugins to your RPG Maker MVs projects plugin directory and configure it using the RPG Maker MV Plugin Manager (F10).

The core plugin is a prerequisite for other dependant plugins contained in this repository. The various non-core plugins plugins are individually described further on.

## Documentation

* [SpellCraft](docs/core/SpellCraft.md) - Core features
* [SpellCraft.EventManager](docs/core/EventManager.md) - Provides a simple observer/emitter-type framework
* [SpellCraft.Time](docs/core/Time.md) - Manages in-game time

## Support

If you require support consider [creating an issue](https://github.com/dfrendin/SpellCraft/issues) here in the github repository. Please try to keep issues specifically related to this plugin as I can't really offer support on RPG Maker MV development or other plugins.

## Contributing

If you wish to submit improvements consider [creating a pull request](https://github.com/dfrendin/SpellCraft/pulls) in the github repository.

## Versioning

The current state of SpellCraft is that its first version is **under development** and **should not be considered ready for production**. Any and all features and naming conventions at this point in time may be subject to change without notice.

I'm working on creating a stable codebase which, once stable, will be labeled "version 1" at which point future development will be made in branches incrementing the project version.
